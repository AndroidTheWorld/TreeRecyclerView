#TreeRecyclerView Demo
 
Using RecyclerView to simulate the view of tree structure.

## Feature
- Using only one RecyclerView.
- The layout of the parent item and child item is different.
- The depth of the tree is positively related to marginLeft.
- The animation of 'expand' or 'hide' is done by adding or removing the children nodes.
